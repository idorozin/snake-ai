# Snake AI - Hamiltonian Cycle
Hamiltonian cycle is a path in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting point. In the context of the snake game, if the snake follows a Hamiltonian cycle, it can continue indefinitely without colliding with itself. 
The AI aims to find a Hamiltonian cycle by identifying the longest path between the snakeâ€™s starting position and an adjacent position (a one-step distance away). On even-sized grids, this path covers all the cells on the board, effectively creating a Hamiltonian cycle. 
A [DEMO](https://idorozin.github.io/snake-ai/). is available

# P5.js
This project is built using p5.js, a JavaScript library designed for creative coding, visualization, and interactive art. The p5.js framework simplifies rendering and animation, making it a great tool for visual projects like this.
